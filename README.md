# 2025-CRA-Commons
Common code base for CRA robots created after the 2025 season based on 2025 wpilib. With this common 
code base and instructions on robot hardware you should be able to create a swerve drive robot that\
can follow autonomous routines developed with path planner and that has localization determined by 
vision and odometry with a live PID tuning feature for any mechanism.
